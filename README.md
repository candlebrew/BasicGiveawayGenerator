# BasicGiveawayGenerator
Use python to pick a winner from a csv (in UTF-8). Yes it's ugly, no I won't fix it.

### Instructions
1. Place your csv in the same directory as the python script. Make sure it contains a header row that matches that in the script; out of the box, it looks for #,Name,ID,Email
2. Run the script. If your csv is named something other than "entries.csv" it will prompt you for it.
3. Winner, ID, and email are printed to the console, and a docx is created as a form that can be printed off and kept on file wherever you keep your giveaway documentation.

#### Why did I make this?
Our giveaway is worth a lot of money compared to other giveaways hosted by other departments, and my paranoia wants to document everything to cover our butts if someone tries to cry foul play. But also...I want it to make the document for me ðŸ¤·
